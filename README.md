Testing volatility models with simulated data

This simulation analysis on R is a replication of paper by Paye (2012). The analysis asserts the differences in statistical tests (Giacomini & White (2006) versus Clark and West (2007) for evaluating the volatility predictive models via the simulation sample of 10000 observations.
